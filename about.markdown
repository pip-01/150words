Ok there are more than 150 words and some are sentences - granted, but the idea was to limit the list to the bare essentials in any major spoken language.

This website is simply one of those "when all else fails ..." type scenarios. You find yourself in a foreign country (when we are all lucky and brave enough to travel again).

Whether you think of it like a checklist of words to learn at home, or even on your phone needing to communicate quickly in a foreign country!

Enjoy.
